This repository discusses simulating federated learning for 5G network slice allocation with a reduced dataset. It covers the principles of federated learning, its advantages, and how it can be applied to network slicing in 5G to enhance data privacy, scalability, and resource allocation. 
There are two files in this repository:
1. Federated Model
2. Centralized Model

The main focus was to explore Federated Learning for Network Slicing and try to build a model without bothering about the accuracy metrics since a minimal dataset has been used.
