# Simulating-Federated-Learning-For-5G-Network-Slice-Allocation-With-Reduced-Dataset
This repository discusses simulating federated learning for 5G network slice allocation with a reduced dataset. It covers the principles of federated learning, its advantages, and how it can be applied to network slicing in 5G to enhance data privacy, scalability, and resource allocation. The methodology involves reducing a large dataset, splitting it for federated learning, and comparing the performance with centralized models.
